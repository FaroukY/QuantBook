# Problem 35: Sum Doppelgangers

Find a pair of 6-sided dice, each labeled with positive integers (not necessarily 1 through 6, and possibly with repeated values), such that when rolled together, the distribution of their sums is the same as that of two standard dice.

Let  

$$
D(x) = x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 = x\,\frac{1 - x^6}{1 - x}
$$  

be the ordinary generating function for a single standard die. Then

$$
D(x)^2 = x^2\,\frac{(1 - x^6)^2}{(1 - x)^2} = x^2\,\frac{(1 - x^2)^2\,(1 + x^2 + x^4)^2}{(1 - x)^2} = x^2\,(1 + x)^2\,(1 + x^2 + x^4)^2.
$$

Next factor  

$$
1 + x^2 + x^4 = (1 + x^2)^2 - x^2 = (1 + x^2 + x)\,(1 + x^2 - x),
$$  

so that  

$$
D(x)^2 = x^2\,(1 + x)^2\,(1 + x^2 + x)^2\,(1 + x^2 - x)^2.
$$

Now observe that we may split the four irreducible factors (besides the overall $x^2$) into two groups of two each:

$$
D(x)^2 = \left[x(1 + x)(1 + x^2 + x)\right] \cdot \left[x(1 + x)(1 + x^2 + x)(1 + x^2 - x)^2\right].
$$

To gain intuition for how to divide the factors between the two dice:

- Each die must include a factor of $x$, so all face values are positive.
- Each die must have exactly 6 faces; the sum of the coefficients of each die's generating function must equal 6.
- Hence we cannot assign both copies of $(1 + x + x^2)$ to one dieâ€”it would yield more than 6 terms.
- Similarly, $(1 + x)^2$ must be split to keep the number of faces valid.

This forces the factor $(1 - x + x^2)^2$ to be entirely on one die, giving rise to a non-symmetric but valid factorization of $D(x)^2$. This construction leads to the **Sicherman dice**, the unique nonstandard integer-labeled dice pair (up to relabeling) that mimics standard dice sums.

Define the two dice:

$$
A(x) = x(1 + x)(1 + x + x^2) = x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \{1,2,2,3,3,4\},
$$

$$
B(x) = x(1 + x)(1 + x^2 + x)(1 + x^2 - x)^2 = x + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^8 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \{1,3,4,5,6,8\}.
$$

Since $A(x)\cdot B(x) = D(x)^2$, rolling these two nonstandard dice gives the same distribution over sums as two ordinary dice.
