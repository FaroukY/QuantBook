# Problem 36: Uniform from Chaos

Is it possible to construct two non-fair $n$-sided dice, each with faces numbered $1$ through $n$, such that when both are rolled, the probability distribution of their sum is uniform? That is, each sum from $2$ to $2n$ occurs with equal probability.

No, such dice do not exist. Assume for contradiction that two non-fair dice exist. Let their face probabilities be  

$$
p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n \quad \text{and} \quad q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n,
$$  

where all $ p_i, q_j > 0 $ and $ \sum p_i = \sum q_j = 1 $.

Suppose that the **sum distribution is uniform** over $ \{2, 3, \dots, 2n\} $. Then for all $ s = 2, \dots, 2n $, we must have:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{sum} = s) = \sum_{i + j = s} p_i q_j = \frac{1}{2n - 1}.
$$

In particular:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{sum} = 2) = p_1 q_1 = \frac{1}{2n - 1}, \quad \mathbb{P}(\text{sum} = 2n) = p_n q_n = \frac{1}{2n - 1}.
$$

Now consider the **middle sum** $ s = n + 1 $. It includes at least the two terms $ p_1 q_n $ and $ p_n q_1 $, so:

$$
p_1 q_n + p_n q_1 \leq \mathbb{P}(\text{sum} = n + 1) = \frac{1}{2n - 1}.
$$

Substitute  

$$
q_1 = \frac{1}{(2n - 1) p_1}, \quad q_n = \frac{1}{(2n - 1) p_n},
$$  

to get:

$$
p_1 \cdot \frac{1}{(2n - 1) p_n} + p_n \cdot \frac{1}{(2n - 1) p_1} \leq \frac{1}{2n - 1}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{p_1}{p_n} + \frac{p_n}{p_1} \leq 1.
$$

But by the **AMâ€“GM inequality**, for any $ x > 0 $,

$$
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2,
$$

so:

$$
\frac{p_1}{p_n} + \frac{p_n}{p_1} \geq 2 > 1,
$$

contradicting the previous inequality. Therefore, no such pair of non-fair dice can exist.
