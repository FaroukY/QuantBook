# Problem 33: Will We Get There?

A fair 6-sided die is rolled repeatedly, and the results are summed cumulatively. Let $u_x$ be the probability that the running total is ever equal to a given integer $x$. What is the value of $\lim_{x \to \infty} u_x$?

```{prf:theorem} Key Renewal Theorem
Let $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ be i.i.d.\ nonnegative integer‐valued random variables with common distribution $F$ and finite mean

$$
\mu = \mathbb{E}[X_{1}] < \infty.
$$

Define the renewal times

$$
S_{0}=0,\quad S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n},
$$

and the renewal mass function

$$
u_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Pr\bigl(S_{n}=k\bigr).
$$

Then

$$
\lim_{k\to\infty} u_{k} = \frac{1}{\mu}.
$$
```

**Explanation:**  
- The sequence $\{S_n\}$ is a *renewal process*: every time you “hit” a level $k$, the process renews and starts afresh.  
- The value $u_k$ is the total probability of ever visiting state $k$ (summing over all possible renewal epochs).  
- Intuitively, if the average jump size is $\mu$, then in the long run you land on new integers about every $\mu$ steps, so the fraction of integers you hit is $1/\mu$.

Here each roll $X_i$ is uniform on $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Hence,

$$
\mu = \mathbb{E}[X_i] = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \frac{7}{2}.
$$

Let

$$
u_x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \Pr(S_n = x)
$$

be the probability the running total ever equals $x$. By the Key Renewal Theorem,

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty} u_x = \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{2}{7}.
$$
