# Problem 23: Gotta Catch â€™Em All

Suppose there are $n$ distinct types of coupons, and each time you obtain a coupon, it is equally likely to be any of the $n$ types, independently of previous draws.

Let $T_n$ be the number of coupons you must collect (with replacement) until you have seen at least one of each type. Compute $\mathbb{E}[T_n]$, the expected number of draws required to collect all $n$ coupon types.

We are given the classic *coupon collector problem*: there are $n$ distinct coupon types, and each draw yields a uniformly random coupon (with replacement). Let $T_n$ be the total number of draws needed until all $n$ types have been seen.

**Strategy: Break into phases.**

Let us compute $\mathbb{E}[T_n]$ by splitting the process into $n$ phases:
- Phase $i$ begins once you have $i-1$ distinct coupons and ends when you collect the $i$-th new (distinct) type.

Let $X_i$ be the number of draws needed in phase $i$, so that:

$$
T_n = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n.
$$

**Distribution of $X_i$:**

When you already have $i-1$ distinct coupons, there are $n - (i - 1)$ new types remaining. So, the probability of drawing a *new* type in this phase is:

$$
p_i = \frac{n - (i - 1)}{n} = \frac{n - i + 1}{n}.
$$

Therefore, $X_i \sim \text{Geometric}(p_i)$, and so:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \frac{1}{p_i} = \frac{n}{n - i + 1}.
$$

**Add expectations:**

$$
\mathbb{E}[T_n] = \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i] = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{n}{n - i + 1} = n \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k} = n H_n,
$$

where $H_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k}$ is the $n$-th harmonic number.

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{ \mathbb{E}[T_n] = n H_n = n \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k} }
$$

Note that asymptotically, $H_n = \Theta(\log n)$, so it takes $\Theta(n \log n)$ draws on expectation to collect all coupons.
