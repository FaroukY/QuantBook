# Problem 26: The Variety Roll

Suppose you roll $n$ fair $k$-sided dice. What is the expected number of distinct faces (numbers $1$ through $k$) that appear at least once among the $n$ rolls?

Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the event that face $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$ appears at least once among the $n$ rolls. We are interested in the expected number of *distinct* faces that appear, which is

$$
S = \sum_{i=1}^k X_i.
$$

By linearity of expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[S] = \sum_{i=1}^k \mathbb{E}[X_i].
$$

Now, for any fixed face $i$, the probability that $i$ does not appear in a single roll is $1-\frac{1}{k}$, and since the rolls are independent, the probability that $i$ is missing from all $n$ rolls is $(1-\frac{1}{k})^n$. Thus,

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \Pr[X_i=1]= 1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)^n.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbb{E}[S] = k \left( 1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{k} \right)^n \right),
$$

which gives the final answer:

$$
\boxed{
\mathbb{E}[\text{number of distinct faces}]
= k \left( 1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{k} \right)^n \right)
}
$$
