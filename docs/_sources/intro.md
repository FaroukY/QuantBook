## Preface

Quantitative trading and research interviews demand both strong technical skills and creative problem-solving. This book is a focused preparation guide for candidates with a solid mathematical background. It features a curated selection of problems with *detailed solutions*, drawn from prior interview questions, quantitative interview prep materials, and classic mathematical puzzle books. The problems span a wide range of topics and are designed to reflect the style and depth of questions used by top quant firms.

## Topics Covered

## Target Audience

This book is intended for readers with mathematical maturity - those comfortable with concepts such as random variables, linearity of expectation, calculus, basic statistics, algorithms, programming, and linear algebra. It does not assume prior experience with competitive problem-solving or timed interviews. While foundational material is not re-taught, new or advanced ideas are introduced as needed. The goal is to help readers translate their theoretical knowledge into the creative, applied reasoning required in quantitative interviews.

## Source of Problems

Many of the problems in this book are considered folklore, having appeared in various sources across the literature. In selecting the problems, the author drew from several well-known references commonly cited in the quantitative finance community, with some overlap among them. All included problems are relatively challenging, and every solution has been independently written by the author.

1. **Problems encountered by the author or colleagues during quant interviews.**  
2. **Problems from competitive mathematics contests** — such as the Putnam, AIME, AMC, HMMT, and IMO — which have appeared in interviews at leading firms.  
3. **Problems from Glassdoor** related to Quant Research and Quant Trading roles at top companies.
