# Problem 3: Game of Throws

Two players, $A$ and $B$, each start with 100 marbles (they do not initially own these marbles but are only playing with them). Simultaneously and independently, they choose to place $a, b \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\}$ marbles, respectively, into a common box. Then, two marbles are drawn with replacement from the box. Each drawn marble is randomly selected from the $a + b$ marbles present, with probability proportional to the number each player contributed.

If a marble belonging to player $A$ is drawn, then player $A$ receives a payment of $100 - a$ from a third party. Similarly, if a marble from $B$ is drawn, $B$ receives $100 - b$.

Assuming both players choose their strategies optimally, what is the expected total payment received by player $A$?

````{dropdown} Click to show solution

If player $A$ contributes $a$ marbles and player $B$ contributes $b$, then the probability that a drawn marble is from $A$ is 

$$
\frac{a}{a+b},
$$

and with two independent draws (with replacement), the expected number of times $A$'s marbles are drawn is 

$$
\frac{2a}{a+b}.
$$

Thus, the expected payment to $A$ is

$$
R_A(a,b) = \frac{2a}{a+b}(100 - a).
$$

Similarly, player $B$'s expected payment is

$$
R_B(a,b) = \frac{2b}{a+b}(100 - b).
$$

**Best-Response Analysis**

Because the game is symmetric, in equilibrium we expect the players to choose the same number of marbles, i.e. $a = b$. To determine the optimal choice, we analyze the best-response function.

Assume player $B$ fixes his choice at $b$. Then player $A$ chooses $a$ to maximize

$$
R_A(a,b) = \frac{2a}{a+b}(100 - a).
$$

Treating $a$ as a continuous variable and differentiating, define

$$
F(a) = \frac{2a(100 - a)}{a + b}.
$$

A calculation using the quotient rule shows that the first-order condition yields

$$
a = -b + \sqrt{b^2 + 100b}.
$$

By symmetry, player $B$â€™s best response is

$$
b = -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 100a}.
$$

At a Nash equilibrium with $a = b$, substitute $b = a$:

$$
a = -a + \sqrt{a^2 + 100a} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 2a = \sqrt{a^2 + 100a}.
$$

Squaring both sides:

$$
4a^2 = a^2 + 100a \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 3a^2 = 100a.
$$

For $a > 0$ (discarding the trivial solution $a = 0$), this simplifies to

$$
a = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33.
$$

Since $a$ must be an integer between 1 and 100, the best integer choices are $33$ or $34$. A short calculation shows that:

- If $a = b = 33$, then  

  $$
  R_A(33, 33) = 100 - 33 = 67
  $$

- If $a = b = 34$, then  

  $$
  R_A(34, 34) = 100 - 34 = 66
  $$

Thus, both players optimally choose $33$ marbles.  
Consequently, player $A$'s expected payment is

$$
\boxed{67}.
$$

**Graphical Illustration of the Best-Response Function**

The best-response function for player $A$, given $b$, is

$$
a = -b + \sqrt{b^2 + 100b}.
$$

Below is a figure that plots this function (in blue) along with the 45-degree line $a = b$ (dashed in gray). Their intersection indicates the Nash equilibrium.
