# Problem 1: The Apple Smugglerâ€™s Dilemma

You are tasked with transporting 3,000 apples a distance of 1,000 miles from Appleland to Bananaville using a truck. The truck can carry at most 1,000 apples at a time.

Each time the truck moves one mile *towards* Bananaville while carrying apples, you must pay a tax of one apple (fractional apples are allowed for fractional miles). However, moving in the opposite direction (towards Appleland) is free. You may make as many trips as needed. You can unload apples anywhere along the path.

Determine the maximum number of apples that can be delivered to Bananaville.

Let $A(x)$ be the maximum number of apples we can transport to a point $0 \leq x \leq 1000$, where $x$ is the number of miles traveled from Appleland. The truck can carry at most 1000 apples at a time.

To move all $A(x)$ apples by an infinitesimal distance $dx$, we must make:

$$
N(x) = \left\lceil \frac{A(x)}{1000} \right\rceil
$$

loaded trips, each of length $dx$, costing $dx$ apples (since we lose one apple per mile). Therefore:

$$
\frac{dA}{dx} = -N(x), \quad A(0) = 3000.
$$

Since the number of trips $N(x)$ drops at $A(x) = 2000$ and $A(x) = 1000$, we divide the problem into three regimes:

---

**Regime I: $A(x) > 2000$ (so $N = 3$)**

We have:

$$
\frac{dA}{dx} = -3, \quad A(0) = 3000
\Rightarrow A(x) = 3000 - 3x.
$$

This continues until $A(x_1) = 2000$:

$$
3000 - 3x_1 = 2000 \Rightarrow x_1 = \frac{1000}{3} \approx 333.33.
$$

---

**Regime II: $1000 < A(x) \leq 2000$ (so $N = 2$)**

Now:

$$
\frac{dA}{dx} = -2, \quad A(x_1) = 2000 
\Rightarrow A(x) = 2000 - 2(x - x_1).
$$

Stop when $A(x_2) = 1000$:

$$
2000 - 2(x_2 - x_1) = 1000 \Rightarrow x_2 = x_1 + 500 = \frac{1000}{3} + 500 \approx 833.33.
$$

---

**Regime III: $A(x) \leq 1000$ (so $N = 1$)**

Finally:

$$
\frac{dA}{dx} = -1, \quad A(x_2) = 1000 
\Rightarrow A(x) = 1000 - (x - x_2).
$$

At the destination $x = 1000$:

$$
A(1000) = 1000 - (1000 - x_2) = x_2 = \frac{1000}{3} + 500 \approx 833.33.
$$

---

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{A(1000) = \frac{1000}{3} + 500 \approx 833.33}
$$
