# Problem 1: Six Knights

There are six knights on a $4\times 3$ chessboard: the three white knights are at the bottom row, and the three black knights are at the top row. Exchange the knights to get the position shown below in the minimum number of knight moves, not allowing more than one knight on a square at any time.

You can play the game below to get a feel for it. Click on a knight, then click on the square you want to move it to.

The minimum number of moves is 16. First, to see a concrete solution:

Next, we prove that we cannot do better than 16. 

![construction](./p1_figures/construction.png)

Consider the initial configuration of the knights and construct an undirected graph representing all legal knight moves from each occupied position. We intentionally "unfold" this graph to simplify our reasoning about lower bounds.

We begin with a simple lower bound: one of the black knights starting at position 1 or 3 must eventually reach position 10 or 12. Without loss of generality, suppose the knight at 3 moves to 10, which requires at least 3 moves. The remaining two black knights must move from 1 to 11 and from 12 to 2, requiring at least 2 moves each, for a total of 7 moves. By symmetry, the same applies to the white knights. Thus, the total number of moves required is at least 14. However, achieving this in 14 moves would necessitate at least one square being occupied by more than one knight at some point, which is illegal, so 14 is not feasible.

To rule out a 15-move solution, suppose for contradiction that there exists a sequence of 15 or fewer legal moves that solves the puzzle. In such a sequence, the black knight at position 1 (WLOG) must reach position 12 in exactly 3 moves (fewer is impossible, and more would already exceed the total move budget). However, for this to happen, the white knight currently at 12 must first vacate that square by moving to 2. For this to occur, the black knight at 2 must first move to 9. But this in turn requires the white knight at 10 to first move to 4, which itself is blocked until the black knight at 3 moves to 11. And that, finally, requires the white knight at 11 to first move to 6.

This creates a dependency chain that delays the black knight’s access to 12 beyond 3 moves, contradicting our assumption. Therefore, a 15-move solution is also impossible.
