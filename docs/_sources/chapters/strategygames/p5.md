# Problem 5: Ace or Bust

You pick an integer $k\in \{1, ...,  52\}$. Then, you draw the first $k$ cards from a standard, shuffled $52$-card deck. You win a prize if the last card you draw is an ace and if there exists exactly one ace in the remaining $52-k$ cards. What $k$ should you pick?

**Step 1: Model the problem**

Each arrangement of the 52 cards is equally likely, and the 4 aces are uniformly randomly distributed among the 52 positions. For a fixed $k$, define:

- Event $A$: The $k^\text{th}$ card is an ace.
- Event $B$: Exactly one ace lies in the remaining $52 - k$ cards (positions $k+1$ through 52).

We want:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{win}) = \mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B \mid A).
$$

---

**Step 2: Compute $\mathbb{P}(A)$**

There are 4 aces and 52 total cards. So:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}.
$$

---

**Step 3: Compute $\mathbb{P}(B \mid A)$**

Given that the $k^\text{th}$ card is an ace, the remaining 3 aces are randomly placed among the other 51 cards (excluding position $k$). We want exactly one of those 3 aces to fall in the remaining $52 - k$ positions (positions $k+1$ to 52).

This is equivalent to choosing 1 of the 3 remaining aces to be in the last $52 - k$ positions and the other 2 to be among the first $k - 1$ positions (excluding position $k$).

So the number of favorable placements is:

$$
\binom{52 - k}{1} \cdot \binom{k - 1}{2}.
$$

The total number of ways to place the 3 remaining aces among the 51 other cards is:

$$
\binom{51}{3}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbb{P}(B \mid A) = \frac{(52 - k) \cdot \binom{k - 1}{2}}{\binom{51}{3}}.
$$

**Step 4: Final expression and maximization**

Combining everything, the probability of winning as a function of $k$ is:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{13} \cdot \frac{(52 - k) \cdot \binom{k - 1}{2}}{\binom{51}{3}}.
$$

Let us define:

$$
f(k) = (52 - k) \cdot \binom{k - 1}{2} = (52 - k) \cdot \frac{(k - 1)(k - 2)}{2}.
$$

Since the denominator $\binom{51}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{13}$ are constant, maximizing the win probability is equivalent to maximizing $f(k)$.

**Step 5: Maximize $f(k)$ using calculus**

We aim to maximize the function:

$$
f(k) = (52 - k) \cdot \frac{(k - 1)(k - 2)}{2}.
$$

Let:

$$
g(k) = (52 - k)(k - 1)(k - 2).
$$

First, expand $g(k)$:

\begin{align*}
g(k) &= (52 - k)(k^2 - 3k + 2) \\
     &= 52k^2 - 156k + 104 - k(k^2 - 3k + 2) \\
     &= 52k^2 - 156k + 104 - (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) \\
     &= -k^3 + 55k^2 - 158k + 104.
\end{align*}

Differentiate:

$$
g'(k) = -3k^2 + 110k - 158.
$$

Set $g'(k) = 0$:

$$
-3k^2 + 110k - 158 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3k^2 - 110k + 158 = 0.
$$

Solve using the quadratic formula:

$$
k = \frac{110 \pm \sqrt{110^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 158}}{2 \cdot 3}
= \frac{110 \pm \sqrt{12100 - 1896}}{6}
= \frac{110 \pm \sqrt{10204}}{6}
= \frac{110 \pm 101}{6}.
$$

So:

$$
k = \frac{211}{6} \approx 35.17, \qquad \text{or} \qquad k = \frac{9}{6} = 1.5.
$$

Since $k \geq 3$ is required for $\binom{k - 1}{2}$ to be defined, we discard $k = 1.5$.  
Thus, the maximum occurs near:

$$
k^* \approx 35.17.
$$

Because $k$ must be an integer, we round to the nearest integer (alternatively try both $k = 35$ and $k = 36$ and choose the better):

$$
\boxed{k = 35}.
$$

---

**Conclusion**

We should draw the first $\boxed{35}$ cards to maximize our chance of winning.
