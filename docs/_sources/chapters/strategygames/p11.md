Note that $37abc$ is divisible by $37$ if and only if $abc$ is divisible by $37$. Inspired by the problem, let's take a 3 digit number divisible by $37$ and rotate it. 

1. $148 = 37 \times 4$. 
2. $481 = 37 \times 13$. 
3. $814 = 37 \times 22$.

If you try a bunch of three digit numbers divisible by $37$, you will see that this patttern is always true. Let's try to prove it:

Claim: If $xyz$ is divisible by $37$, then $yzx$ is also divisible by $37$.

Proof: Modulo $37$, we compute:

$$
\begin{aligned}
xyz - yzx &\equiv 100x + 10y + z - (100y + 10z + x) \\
&\equiv 99x - 90y - 9z \\
&\equiv 9(11x - 10y - z)
\end{aligned}
$$

Now cleverly add and subtract a multiple of $xyz = 100x + 10y + z$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
9(11x - 10y - z) &= 9(11x - 10y - z) + 18(100x + 10y + z) - 18(100x + 10y + z) \\
&= 9(11x - 10y - z + 2(100x + 10y + z)) - 18(xyz) \\
&= 9(11x - 10y - z + 200x + 20y + 2z) - 18(xyz) \\
&= 9(211x + 10y + z) - 18(xyz)
\end{aligned}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
xyz - yzx &\equiv 9(100x + 10y + z) + 999x \\
&= 9 \cdot xyz + 999x
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, since $xyz \equiv 0 \pmod{37}$, and $999x \equiv 0 \pmod{37}$ because $999 = 27 \cdot 37$, we get:

$$
xyz - yzx \equiv 0 \pmod{37} \quad \Rightarrow \quad yzx \equiv xyz \equiv 0 \pmod{37}
$$

Thus, if $xyz$ is divisible by $37$, then so is $yzx$. â–¡
