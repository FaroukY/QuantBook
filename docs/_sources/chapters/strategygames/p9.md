# Problem 9: Stacked Against You

You start with three piles of coins: 5, 49, and 51.

You can do two types of moves:

* **Split**: If a pile has an even number of coins, you can split it into two equal piles.
* **Merge**: Combine any two piles into one pile by adding their sizes.

**Goal**: Is it possible to end up with 105 piles, each with exactly one coin?

All three initial piles are **odd**, so no splits are possible at the start.  
First move must be a **merge**.

Try each possible merge:

- 5 + 49 = 54 → new set: {54, 51}
- 5 + 51 = 56 → new set: {49, 56}
- 49 + 51 = 100 → new set: {5, 100}

Check the GCDs:

- gcd(54, 51) = 3  
- gcd(56, 49) = 7  
- gcd(5, 100) = 5  

Key idea: Once the GCD of all piles is some odd number > 1, it stays that way.

- Merging preserves divisibility.
- Splitting an even number into two halves keeps divisibility by odd numbers.

So we’re stuck: all resulting piles will always be divisible by 3, 5, or 7 — never by 1.  
That means we can **never** reach piles of size 1.
