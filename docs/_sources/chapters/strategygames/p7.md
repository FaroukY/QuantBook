# Problem 7: 3 Horses to Rule Them All

You are given 25 horses and need to determine the top 3 fastest horses among them. You may conduct races involving at most 5 horses at a time. A race only reveals the **relative ranking** (1st to 5th) of the horses in that race â€” no actual speed measurements are available.

What is the **minimum number of races** required, in the worst case, to determine the 3 fastest horses overall?

We can do it in **7 races**. 

We are given 25 horses and can only race 5 at a time, with each race providing only the relative ordering (1st to 5th). Our goal is to find the **top 3 fastest horses overall**, using as few races as possible in the worst case.

**Group into heats (5 races)**

Divide the 25 horses into 5 groups of 5 horses each. Race each group once.

- After these 5 races, label the horses in each group by their finish order:
  - Group A: A1 > A2 > A3 > A4 > A5
  - Group B: B1 > B2 > B3 > B4 > B5
  - Group C: C1 > C2 > C3 > C4 > C5
  - Group D: D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 > D5
  - Group E: E1 > E2 > E3 > E4 > E5

This takes **5 races**.

**Race the 5 winners (1 race)**

Race the first-place horses from each group:

- Race: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1  
- Suppose the result is: A1 > B1 > C1 > D1 > E1

This race tells us:
- A1 is the overall fastest.

Now we need to identify which horses might still be in contention for 2nd or 3rd place. Candidates for 2nd and 3rd are:
- A2 and A3 (they lost only to A1 in the first race).
- B1 (came 2nd in winners race).
- B2 (lost only to B1 in group B).
- C1 (came 3rd in winners race).

So we race these 5 horses: A2, A3, B1, B2, C1. This is the **7th race**. The top 2 finishers in this race are the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses overall.
