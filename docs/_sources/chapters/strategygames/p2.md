# Problem 2: Among Us: The Algorithmic Edition

There are $2n$ undercover agents in Don's lair. Fewer than $n$ of them are terrorists, and the rest are anti-terrorists. The identities are top-secret, and no external evidence can be used to distinguish between them.

However, each agent knows who among them is a terrorist and who is an anti-terrorist, as they have previously worked together. You may perform queries of the following form: ask agent $i$ whether agent $j$ is an anti-terrorist.

1. Anti-terrorists always answer truthfully.
2. Terrorists may lie arbitrarily.

Your goal is to identify at least one anti-terrorist using as few queries as possible (this will give you the identity of everyone).

Devise a strategy with as few queries required as possible in the worst case. Can you prove that the number of queries you use is the smallest possible?

We have $2n$ agents, of whom at most $n-1$ are terrorists and hence at least $n+1$ are anti‑terrorists.  
We wish to identify one anti‑terrorist using as few queries of the form

$$
\text{“Agent }i,\;\text{is agent }j\text{ an anti‑terrorist?”}
$$

(anti‑terrorists always answer truthfully; terrorists may lie arbitrarily).

**1. A $(2n-1)$‑query algorithm**

Label the agents $1,2,\dots,2n$.  
Maintain a *candidate* $c$ and a counter $m$.  
Initialize:

$$
c \leftarrow 1, \quad m \leftarrow 0.
$$

Then for $i = 2, 3, \dots, 2n$, do:

1. Query agent $i$: “Is agent $c$ an anti‑terrorist?”  

   $$
   Q_i:\quad i \to c\;?
   $$
   
2. If the answer is *Yes*, set $m \leftarrow m + 1$.  
   If the answer is *No*, set $m \leftarrow m - 1$.
3. If $m < 0$, reset $c \leftarrow i$ and $m \leftarrow 0$.

This uses exactly $2n - 1$ queries. At the end, output $c$.

**Correctness**

Anti-terrorists always tell the truth, and since they form a majority ($\geq n+1$), the algorithm ensures that even if a terrorist temporarily becomes the candidate, the majority of truthful responses in the remaining anti-terrorists will eventually correct the candidate to an anti. Each query reduces uncertainty by leveraging the majority rule.

**2. An (almost) matching lower bound**

Suppose there are exactly $n-1$ terrorists among the $2n$ agents. Then the number of possible valid configurations of identities is

$$
\binom{2n}{n-1}
$$

since we can choose any $n-1$ agents to be terrorists.  
Any correct algorithm must distinguish between all these configurations in order to reliably identify at least one anti-terrorist.  
Each query returns a binary response (YES or NO), so it gives at most $1$ bit of information.  
Therefore, the number of queries needed is at least

$$
\log_2 \binom{2n}{n-1}
$$

We can write

$$
\binom{2n}{n-1} = \binom{2n}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{n+1}
$$

and use the standard asymptotic estimate:

$$
\binom{2n}{n} \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{n\pi}}
$$

Thus,

$$
\log_2 \binom{2n}{n-1} = \log_2 \left( \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{n\pi}} \cdot \frac{n}{n+1} \right)
= 2n - \frac{1}{2} \log_2(n\pi) + \log_2\left( \frac{n}{n+1} \right) = 2n - \Theta(\log n)
$$

Hence, any correct algorithm must make at least $2n - \Theta(\log n)$ queries in the worst case.

---

**Conclusion**

$\boxed{2n - 1}$ queries are sufficient, and  
$\boxed{2n - \Theta(\log n)}$ are necessary.  
Can you tighten the bound?
