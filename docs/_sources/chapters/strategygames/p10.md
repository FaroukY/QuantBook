# Problem 10: Stay in Your Lane

How many lattice paths are there from $(0, 0)$ to $(r, s)$ using only steps right $(1, 0)$ and up $(0, 1)$, without ever crossing the line $y = x$?
You are allowed to touch the line $y = x$, but not go above it.
Assume $r \geq s$.

This is a classic "Ballot Problem"-style question with a reflection argument.

We want the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(r,s)$ that **never cross** the line $y = x$ (stay on or below it). Since steps are either right or up, each path consists of \$r\$ right moves and \$s\$ up moves.

The total number of paths (ignoring the $y \leq x$ condition) is just:

$$
\binom{r + s}{s}
$$

You choose when to make the $s$ up moves out of $r + s$ total steps.

Next, we subtract bad paths (those that cross the line). We apply the **reflection principle**:

1) Any path that crosses \$y = x\$ must cross it for the **first time** at some point, say at $(k, k+1)$.
2) Reflect the part of the path **after** this point across the line $y = x+1$ (i.e the banned line).
3) This creates a bijection between paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(s-1, r+1)$ that cross the line and paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(r-1, s+1)$ that just use right and up moves.

Thus, the number of such “bad” paths turns out to be:

$$
\binom{r - 1 + s + 1}{s - 1}
$$

So the number of **good** paths (those staying on or below the diagonal) is:

$$
\boxed{ \binom{r + s}{s} - \binom{r + s}{s - 1} }
$$
