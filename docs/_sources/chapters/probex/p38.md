# Problem 38: The Two-Win Rule

To win a reward, Elmer must win at least two games _in a row_ in a three-game challenge. He plays two opponents: his older sibling Alex (a weaker player) and the neighborhood champ Riley (a stronger player).

Elmer can choose the play order:

- Alex → Riley → Alex, or  
- Riley → Alex → Riley.

Which order should Elmer choose to maximize his chance of winning two consecutive games?

Let $p_A$ be the probability that Elmer beats Alex, and $p_R$ the probability they beat Riley.

**Case 1: Elmer plays Alex first (Alex–Riley–Alex)**

Elmer wins at least two in a row if one of the following happens:
- Win Alex, win Riley, lose Alex: $p_A \cdot p_R \cdot (1 - p_A)$
- Lose Alex, win Riley, win Alex: $(1 - p_A) \cdot p_R \cdot p_A$
- Win all three: $p_A \cdot p_R \cdot p_A$

So the total probability is:

$$
p_A p_R (1 - p_A) + (1 - p_A) p_R p_A + p_A p_R p_A = p_A p_R + (1 - p_A) p_R p_A
$$

**Case 2: Elmer plays Riley first (Riley–Alex–Riley)**

Similarly, the success scenarios are:
- Win Riley, win Alex, lose Riley: $p_R \cdot p_A \cdot (1 - p_R)$
- Lose Riley, win Alex, win Riley: $(1 - p_R) \cdot p_A \cdot p_R$
- Win all three: $p_R \cdot p_A \cdot p_R$

So the total probability is:

$$
p_R p_A (1 - p_R) + (1 - p_R) p_A p_R + p_R p_A p_R = p_A p_R + (1 - p_R) p_A p_R
$$

---

**Comparison**

We compare:

$$
p_A p_R + (1 - p_R) p_A p_R \quad \text{vs.} \quad p_A p_R + (1 - p_A) p_R p_A
$$

These are equal **if and only if** $p_R = p_A$, but since Riley is the stronger player, we assume:

$$
p_R \leq p_A
$$

Thus,

$$
(1 - p_R) p_A p_R \geq (1 - p_A) p_R p_A
$$

and Elmer has a higher chance of winning **if they play Riley first and last**.

**Intuition**

It may seem counter-intuitive: wouldn’t you want to face the weaker player (Alex) twice? But notice that in both cases, **Elmer must beat the middle opponent** to have any chance. So placing the *weaker* opponent in the middle increases the overall chance of chaining two wins.

The best strategy, as always: do the math and trust the algebra.
