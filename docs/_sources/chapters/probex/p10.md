# Problem 10: Practice Makes Probability

A basketball player is practicing free throws. He will take exactly $2n$ shots. For each shot, he scores 1 point if the ball passes through the hoop, and 0 otherwise.

On his first two shots, he makes the first basket but misses the second one. Starting with the third shot, the probability that he makes a basket is equal to the fraction of shots he has made so far. For example, if he has made $23$ baskets after $40$ shots, the probability of making the $41^\text{st}$ shot is $\frac{23}{40}$.

What is the probability that he finishes with exactly $n$ successful baskets after all $2n$ shots (including the first two)?

Consider any of the remaining $2n - 2$ shots, and choose the positions of the $n - 1$ remaining successes (since the first two shots are fixed: a success followed by a failure). This gives a total of

$$
\binom{2n - 2}{n - 1}
$$

valid trajectories that result in exactly $n$ total successes.

We claim that each such trajectory has the same probability:

$$
\frac{(n - 1)!^2}{(2n - 1)!}.
$$

**Example (for intuition):** Let $n = 4$, so we have $8$ total shots, and the first two are $S, F$. We need $3$ more successes and $3$ more failures in the remaining $6$ shots.

Take the trajectory: `SSSFFF`. The success probabilities are:

$$
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \quad \text{(successes)}
$$

followed by failure probabilities:

$$
1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad
1 - \frac{3}{5}= \frac{2}{5}, \quad
1 - \frac{3}{6}= \frac{3}{6}.
$$

Multiplying:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{6} \cdot \frac{3}{7}
= \frac{3! \cdot 3!}{7!}.
$$

Try a different sequence, say `SFSSFF`. The success probabilities are:

$$
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{4}, \frac{3}{5}
$$

and the failure probabilities:

$$
\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{6}, \frac{3}{7}.
$$

Again, the total probability is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{6} \cdot \frac{3}{7}
= \frac{3! \cdot 3!}{7!}.
$$

This pattern holds in general: each time we get a success, the numerator of the success probability increases by 1; likewise, each failure increases the numerator of the failure probability by 1. There are $(n-1)$ successes and $(n-1)$ failures in the final $2n - 2$ shots, so the numerator accumulates a factor of $(n - 1)!$ for the successes and $(n - 1)!$ for the failures, while the denominator is always:

$$
(2n - 1)!,
$$

since the denominator at each step is the number of shots taken so far (from shot 3 to shot $2n$).

Thus, each such trajectory has probability

$$
\frac{(n - 1)!^2}{(2n - 1)!},
$$

and there are $\binom{2n - 2}{n - 1}$ of them, so the total probability of ending with exactly $n$ successes is:

$$
\binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} \cdot \frac{(n - 1)!^2}{(2n - 1)!} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2n - 1}}.
$$
