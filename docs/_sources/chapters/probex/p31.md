# Problem 31: One Equals Two

Three fair $n$-sided dice are rolled independently. What is the probability, $p_n$, that the sum of two of the rolled values equals the value of the third?

We roll three fair $n$-sided dice independently. Let the outcomes be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We want the probability that the sum of any two equals the third, i.e., that $a + b = c$, or $a + c = b$, or $b + c = a$.

Letâ€™s count the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying one of these conditions. There are two disjoint cases:

**Case 1: Two values are equal.**

Suppose $a = b$ and $a + b = c$. Then $c = 2a$, and we must have $1 \le a \le \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ so that $2a \le n$. Each such triple $(a, a, 2a)$ corresponds to a unique value of $a$, and since the positions of the values can be permuted in $3$ ways (e.g., $(a,a,c)$, $(a,c,a)$, $(c,a,a)$), we get a total of:

$$
3 \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor
$$

valid ordered triples from this case.

**Case 2: All values are distinct.**

We now count the number of *distinct* triples $(a, b, c)$ such that the sum of two equals the third and $a$, $b$, $c$ are all different. Without loss of generality, assume $a + b = c$, with $a < b < c$.

For each $a$ from $1$ to $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, we consider all $b > a$ such that $c = a + b \le n$. So $b \le n - a$. Hence:

$$
\text{Number of such }\{a, b, c\} =
\sum_{a = 1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}
\sum_{b = a + 1}^{n - a} 1
= \sum_{a = 1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} (n - 2a).
$$

This is an arithmetic sum:

$$
\sum_{a = 1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} (n - 2a)
= \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor (n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor - 1).
$$

Since there are $6$ permutations of any distinct triple $\{a,b,c\}$, the total number of such ordered triples is:

$$
6 \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \cdot \left(n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\right).
$$

**Total valid outcomes:**

$$
3 \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor
+ 6 \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \cdot \left(n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\right)
= \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \cdot \left(3 + 6(n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor - 1)\right).
$$

The total number of ordered triples is $n^3$, so the final probability is:

$$
p_n = \frac{
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \cdot \left(3 + 6(n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor - 1)\right)
}{
n^3
}.
$$

**For even $n$ (say $n = 2m$):**

Then $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor = m$ and:

$$
p_n = \frac{m \cdot (3 + 6(n - m - 1))}{n^3}
= \frac{m \cdot (3 + 6m - 6)}{8m^3}
= \frac{m(6m - 3)}{8m^2}
= \frac{3(2m - 1)}{8m^2}
= \frac{3(n - 1)}{2n^2}, \quad \text{since } n = 2m.
$$

One can also verify that for odd $n$, the same formula holds.

**Conclusion:**

Whether $n$ is even or odd, the expression simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{p_n = \frac{3(n - 1)}{2n^2}}.
