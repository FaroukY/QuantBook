# Problem 29: Never Back Down

You roll a fair $k$-sided die $n$ times, for $n\geq k$. What is the probability that the sequence of rolls is non-decreasing (i.e., each roll is greater than or equal to the previous one)?

We wish to compute the probability that a sequence of $n$ rolls of a fair $k$-sided die is *non-decreasing*, i.e.,

$$
X_1 \le X_2 \le \dots \le X_n, \quad\text{where each } X_i \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}.
$$

Any non-decreasing sequence of $n$ integers from $\{1,\dots,k\}$ can be represented by choosing how many times each number appears in the order $1,2,\dots, k$. That is, let $x_i$ denote how many times the value $i$ appears, for $i = 1,\dots,k$, subject to:

$$
x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n, \quad x_i \ge 0.
$$

This is a classic integer partition (a.k.a. stars-and-bars) problem. The number of such tuples is:

$$
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}.
$$

There are $k^n$ total sequences of $n$ rolls from a $k$-sided die. Hence, the desired probability is:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{ \binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} }{k^n}
}.
$$
