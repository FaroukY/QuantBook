# Problem 22: Rollinâ€™ Uphill

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and consider a fair $n$-sided die with faces $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$. You repeatedly roll the die and accumulate the sum of the outcomes.

Let $T_n$ denote the number of rolls needed for the cumulative sum to reach or exceed $n$ for the first time.

Determine $\mathbb{E}[T_n]$.

**Step 1. Reformulate Using Tail Probabilities.**

A standard technique is to use the tail formula for calculating Expectation

$$
\mathbb{E}[T_n] = \sum_{k \ge 0} \mathbb{P}[T_n > k].
$$

Here, the event $\{T_n > k\}$ means that after $k$ rolls the cumulative sum is still less than $n$.

**Step 2. Counting Favorable Outcomes.**

Let $x_1,\dots,x_k$ be the outcomes of the first $k$ rolls. Since each roll yields an integer in $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, the smallest possible sum is $k$ (if every roll is $1$) and the largest is $kn$.  
We have $T_n > k$ if and only if

$$
x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k \le n - 1.
$$

Introduce new variables: $y_i = x_i - 1 \ge 0$; then the inequality becomes

$$
y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_k \le (n - 1) - k.
$$

The number of nonnegative integer solutions to

$$
y_1 + \cdots + y_k \le m
$$

is given by the stars and bars formula:

$$
{ m + k \choose k }.
$$

In our case, $m = n - 1 - k$, so the number of solutions is

$$
\binom{n - 1}{k}.
$$

On the other hand, the total number of possible outcomes for $k$ rolls is $n^k$. Therefore, we have

$$
\mathbb{P}[T_n > k] = \frac{ \binom{n - 1}{k} }{ n^k },
$$

but note that once $k \ge n$ the inequality $x_1 + \cdots + x_k \le n - 1$ becomes impossible. Hence, the sum is over $k = 0,1,\dots,n - 1$.

**Step 3. Express the Expectation.**

Using the tail-sum formula,

$$
\mathbb{E}[T_n] = \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} \mathbb{P}[T_n > k]
= \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} \binom{n - 1}{k} \frac{1}{n^k}.
$$

Recognize that by the Binomial Theorem (writing $1/n$ in place of the variable),

$$
\sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} \binom{n - 1}{k} \frac{1}{n^k} = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1}.
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{ \mathbb{E}[T_n] = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{\,n - 1} }.
$$
