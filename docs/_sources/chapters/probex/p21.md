# Problem 21: Déjà Roll

You are repeatedly rolling a fair six-sided die. Let $T$ be the number of rolls required until the same face appears twice (not necessarily in a row). What is the expected value of $T$?

Generalize your answer to a fair $N$-sided die.

First, the answer can be $n \leq N+1$ by Pigeonhole. Also, $T \geq n$ if and only if the first $n-1$ rolls are different, which happens with probability 

$$
\frac{N \cdot (N - 1) \cdot \dots \cdot (N - n + 2)}{N^{n - 1}} = \frac{N!}{(N - n + 1)! N^{n - 1}}.
$$

So, 

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = \sum_{n=1}^{N+1} \mathbb{P}[T \geq n] = \sum_{n=1}^{N+1} \frac{N!}{(N - n + 1)! N^{n - 1}} = \boxed{ \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{N!}{(N - n)! N^n} }.
$$

For $N = 6$, the answer is $1223 / 324 \approx 3.775$.
