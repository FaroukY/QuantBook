# Problem 27: High Roller

Suppose you roll $n$ independent fair $k$-sided dice and keep only the highest value (breaking ties arbitrarily). What is the probability distribution of the value of the result?

Let $M$ be the maximum value obtained when rolling $n$ independent fair $k$-sided dice. We wish to compute the probability mass function of $M$, that is, $\Pr[M = i]$ for $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$.

Observe that:

$$
\Pr[M = i] = \Pr[M \le i] - \Pr[M \le i - 1].
$$

Since the maximum of $n$ i.i.d.\ variables is $\le i$ if and only if *all* of them are $\le i$, and since each individual roll is uniformly distributed over $\{1, 2, \dots, k\}$, we have:

$$
\Pr[M \le i] = \left( \frac{i}{k} \right)^n.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\Pr[M = i] = \left( \frac{i}{k} \right)^n - \left( \frac{i-1}{k} \right)^n = \boxed{ \frac{i^n - (i - 1)^n}{k^n} }, \quad i=1,2,\dots, k.
$$
