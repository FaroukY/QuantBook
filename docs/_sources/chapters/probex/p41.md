# Problem 41: HHH vs. THH: Dawn of Flips

You're playing a coin-tossing game where you flip a fair coin repeatedly until you get either `HHH` or `THH` consecutively. What is the probability of getting a `HHH` before `THH`?

First, note that if at any point before `HHH` appears, a flip outcome is `T`, then `HHH` can no longer appear before `THH`.

To see why, suppose a `T` occurs. The next time we see a run of `HH`, the flip immediately preceding it must be that `T` (since otherwise this wouldn't be the first occurrence of `HH`). But then the pattern `THH` has occurred before `HHH`, and so `THH` wins.

This implies: for `HHH` to appear first, no `T` can occur before it. Therefore, the only way for `HHH` to appear before `THH` is if the first three flips are exactly: `HHH`. 

The probability of this is:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\texttt{HHH}) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \boxed{\frac{1}{8}}.
