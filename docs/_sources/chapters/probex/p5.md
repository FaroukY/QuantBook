# Problem 5: One Too Many

Let $X_1, X_2, ...$ be an infinite number of random variables drawn uniformly at random from $[0, 1]$. Let $K$ be the minimum integer such that $X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_K > 1$. What is $\mathbb{E}[K]$ ?

Define for $0 \leq t \leq 1$ the function:

$$
f(t) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min\{m \geq 1: X_1 + \dots + X_m > t\}\right].
$$

Note that our desired expectation is $f(1)$. Conditioning on the first random variable $X_1$, uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, we obtain the integral equation:

$$
f(t) = 1 + \int_0^t f(t - y)\,dy, \quad \text{with } f(0)=1.
$$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $t$ (by the Leibniz rule), we get:

$$
f'(t) = f(t), \quad f(0) = 1.
$$

This differential equation has the unique solution:

$$
f(t) = e^t.
$$

Thus, the expected value is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[K] = f(1) = e.
$$

**Final answer:**

$$
\boxed{e}
$$
