# Problem 40: Love Thy Neighbor

Suppose $ m $ bachelors and $ b $ bachelorettes are seated uniformly at random in a row of $ m + b $ seats. Each seat is occupied by exactly one person.

Define a **dating index** $ i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, m + b - 1\} $ to be a position such that the person sitting in seat $i$ and the person sitting in seat $i+1$ are of opposite genders (i.e., one is a bachelor, the other a bachelorette).

What is the expected number of such dating indices?

Let $X_i$ be the indicator variable for whether index $i$ is a *dating index*. Then the total number of dating indices is given by:

$$
S = \sum_{i=1}^{m+b-1} X_i.
$$

To compute the expected value $\mathbb{E}[S]$, we first determine $\mathbb{E}[X_i]$. A dating index occurs if two adjacent elements at positions $i$ and $i+1$ are of opposite types (one a bachelor, one bachelorette). 

The probability that a given pair $(i,i+1)$ is a dating pair is:

$$
\Pr[X_i = 1] = \frac{m}{m+b} \cdot \frac{b}{m+b-1} + \frac{b}{m+b} \cdot \frac{m}{m+b-1}
= \frac{2mb}{(m+b)(m+b-1)}.
$$

By linearity of expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[S] = \sum_{i=1}^{m+b-1} \mathbb{E}[X_i] = (m+b-1) \cdot \frac{2mb}{(m+b)(m+b-1)}.
$$

**Final Answer**  

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[S] = \frac{2mb}{m+b}}.
