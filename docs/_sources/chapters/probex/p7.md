# Problem 7: The Backstep Bunny

There are $n\geq 2$ stones in a row labelled $1$ to $n$ from left to right. A bunny starts at stone $1$ and on each turn hops to a new stone that they haven’t visited yet. After visiting all the stones, what is the probability the bunny made exactly one leftwards jump? Assume that the bunny is equally likely to jump to any of the remaining unvisited stones with equal probability.

We are given $n \geq 2$ stones arranged in a line, labeled $1$ through $n$ from left to right. A rabbit starts at stone $1$ and hops to a new, unvisited stone on each turn, chosen uniformly at random among the remaining unvisited stones. After visiting all $n$ stones, we are to compute the probability that the rabbit made exactly one leftward jump.

### Step 1: Total number of paths

After visiting stone $1$, the rabbit must visit the remaining $n-1$ stones in some order. Each such order corresponds to a permutation of $\{2, 3, \dots, n\}$, and all permutations are equally likely. Thus, the total number of possible paths is:

$$
(n-1)!.
$$

---

### Step 2: Characterizing paths with exactly one leftward jump

We now count the number of permutations in which the rabbit makes exactly one move to the left.

Let the rabbit move strictly right from stone $1$ to stone $i$, visiting stones $2, 3, \dots, i$ in order. The first $i - 1$ jumps are thus all rightward. The rabbit then jumps to a stone $j > i$, skipping over some stones.

From $j$, the rabbit continues rightward through stones $j+1, j+2, \dots, k$. At this point, the rabbit makes its single leftward jump to one of the skipped stones—specifically to $i+1$ (the smallest unvisited stone)—then continues rightward through the remaining skipped stones $i+2, \dots, j-1$, and finally continues with any remaining unvisited stones after $k$.

Each such triple $(i, j, k)$ uniquely determines such a path.

  \node[red] at (6.25, 0.9) {\small leftward jump};
\end{tikzpicture}

```

### Step 3: Counting such paths

We now count the number of such valid triples:

- $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n-1$  
- $j$ ranges from $i+1$ to $n$  
- $k$ ranges from $j$ to $n$

So the count is:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \sum_{k=j}^{n} 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} (n - j + 1).
$$

Rewriting:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{m=1}^{n - i} m = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{(n - i)(n - i + 1)}{2}.
$$

Let $r = n - i$:

$$
\sum_{r=1}^{n-1} \frac{r(r+1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{r=1}^{n-1} (r^2 + r)
$$

which evaluates to:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \right) = \frac{n(n^2 - 1)}{6}.
$$

Hence, the number of such paths is:

$$
\frac{n(n^2 - 1)}{6} = \frac{n^3 - n}{6}.
$$

---

### Step 4: Final probability

Since all $(n-1)!$ paths are equally likely, the desired probability is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{n^3 - n}{6(n - 1)!}}.
$$
