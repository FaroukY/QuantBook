# Problem 28: Runaway Sixes

```{note}
This problem requires some programming experience/environment
```

You roll a fair 6-sided die $n$ times. What is the probability that there is a run of at least $r$ consecutive sixes?

````{dropdown} Click to show solution

Let $p_n$ be the probability that a run of at least $r$ consecutive sixes occurs within $n$ independent rolls of a fair 6-sided die.

**Base cases:**  
Clearly, for $n < r$, the event is impossible:

$$
p_0 = p_1 = \dots = p_{r-1} = 0.
$$

When $n = r$, the only way to get a run of $r$ sixes is if *all* $r$ rolls are sixes:

$$
p_r = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^r.
$$

**Recurrence for $n \ge r$:**  
There are two disjoint ways that a run of $r$ sixes can occur in $n+1$ rolls:

1. It already occurred within the first $n$ rolls. This contributes $p_n$.

2. It occurs *for the first time* ending at position $n+1$.  
   For this to happen:

   - The first $n - r$ rolls must avoid any run of $r$ sixes: probability $1 - p_{n - r}$.
   - The $(n - r + 1)$-th roll must *not* be a six: probability $5/6$.
   - The next $r$ rolls must all be sixes: probability $(1/6)^r$.

   So this contributes:

   $$
   (1 - p_{n - r}) \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^r.
   $$

Putting it together:

$$
p_{n+1} = p_n + (1 - p_{n - r}) \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6^r}.
$$

Now we compute the value.
