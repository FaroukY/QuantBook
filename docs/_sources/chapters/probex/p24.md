# Problem 24: Chasing 65

On average, how many times must a fair 6-sided die be rolled until the sequence `6, 5` appears (i.e., a 6 followed immediately by a 5)?

Let $E_{65}$ be the expected number of rolls until the sequence $65$ appears (i.e., a $6$ followed immediately by a $5$).

Define:

- $T_1$: number of rolls to get the first $6$. Since a fair die shows $6$ with probability $1/6$, we have $\mathbb{E}[T_1] = 6$.
- $T_2$: number of additional rolls until the next number that is *not* a $6$. Since the probability of getting a non-$6$ is $5/6$, we have $\mathbb{E}[T_2] = 1/(5/6) = \frac{6}{5}$.

After seeing the first $6$ and the first non-$6$:

- With probability $\frac{1}{5}$, the non-$6$ is a $5$, and we are done â€” no more rolls needed.
- With probability $\frac{4}{5}$, we saw something other than $5$, so we must start over, incurring another expected cost of $E_{65}$.

Therefore, the recurrence is:

$$
E_{65} = T_1 + T_2 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \cdot 0 + \frac{4}{5} \cdot E_{65} \right)
= 6 + \frac{6}{5} + \frac{4}{5}E_{65}.
$$

Solving:

$$
E_{65} - \frac{4}{5}E_{65} = 6 + \frac{6}{5}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{5}E_{65} = \frac{36}{5}
$$

$$
E_{65} = \boxed{36}.
