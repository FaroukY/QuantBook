# Problem 32: Summing the Climb

A fair $n$-sided die is rolled repeatedly until a value $\geq k$ appears (where $1 \leq k \leq n$). Let the values of all rolls (including the final roll) be summed. What is the expected value of this total sum?

**Wald’s Identity** states that if $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean $\mu = \mathbb{E}[X_1]$, and $T$ is a stopping time such that $\mathbb{E}[T] < \infty$, then:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{T} X_i \right] = \mathbb{E}[T] \cdot \mathbb{E}[X_1].
$$

**Stopping Time:** A random variable $T$ is called a stopping time with respect to the sequence $\\{X_i\\}$ if the event $\\{T = t\\}$ depends only on the values of $X_1, \dots, X_t$ (i.e., we can tell whether to stop at time $t$ without knowing future values).

Let $T$ be the first time a value $\geq k$ appears when rolling i.i.d. random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots$ uniformly from $\\{1, 2, \dots, n\\}$. Then:

- $T$ is a stopping time with respect to the sequence $\\{X_i\\}$.
- Let $S = \sum_{i=1}^T X_i$ be the sum of the values rolled up to and including the first roll $\geq k$.
- Note that for $i = 1$ to $T - 1$, each $X_i$ is uniformly distributed over $\\{1, 2, \dots, k - 1\\}$, and $X_T$ is uniformly distributed over $\\{k, k + 1, \dots, n\\}$.

By linearity of expectation and Wald’s identity, we have:

$$
\mathbb{E}[S]
= \mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_{i=1}^T X_i\right]
= \mathbb{E}[T-1] \cdot \mathbb{E}[X_i \mid X_i < k] + \mathbb{E}[X_T].
$$

**Why Wald’s identity applies here:**

- The random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots$ are i.i.d. uniform on $\\{1, 2, \dots, n\\}$.
- The stopping time $T$ is the first index $t$ such that $X_t \geq k$; this depends only on $X_1, \dots, X_t$, satisfying the stopping condition.
- We split the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{T} X_i$ as:  
  the sum of $T - 1$ i.i.d. values $< k$, plus $X_T$ (which has a different distribution).  
  So we apply Wald’s identity only to the $T - 1$ terms (before stopping), and compute $\mathbb{E}[X_T]$ separately.

**Let us compute the pieces:**

- The probability of success on any roll (i.e., $X_i \geq k$) is $\frac{n - k + 1}{n}$, so $T \sim \text{Geom}\left( \frac{n - k + 1}{n} \right)$. Hence:

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = \frac{n}{n - k + 1}.
$$

- The expected value of a roll conditioned on being less than $k$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_i \mid X_i < k] = \frac{1 + (k - 1)}{2} = \frac{k}{2}.
$$

- The expected value of $X_T \sim \text{Unif}(\\{k, \dots, n\\})$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_T] = \frac{k + n}{2}.
$$

Putting it together:

$$
\mathbb{E}[S] 
= \left( \frac{n}{n - k + 1} - 1 \right) \cdot \frac{k}{2} + \frac{k + n}{2} = \boxed{\frac{n(n + 1)}{2(n - k + 1)}}.
$$
