# Problem 18: No Change, No Problem

A line of $2n$ customers is waiting to buy tickets, each priced at \$5. Among them, exactly $n$ customers carry a \$5 bill, and the remaining $n$ carry a \$10 bill. The ticket seller starts with no change. Each customer purchases exactly one ticket, and no one is allowed to switch places in line.

Assuming the customers arrive in a uniformly random order, what is the probability that every transaction can be completed successfully (i.e., the seller always has sufficient change when needed)?

We begin by labeling the customers:

$$
\text{Red}:\; \text{Customers with a \$5 bill}, \quad \text{Blue}:\; \text{Customers with a \$10 bill}.
$$

In order for the seller to be able to give change for a blue customer, there must be a preceding red customer in the line (i.e., one who has already paid with a \$5 bill). Therefore, a necessary and sufficient condition for every transaction to be successful is that for every initial segment of the sequence, the number of red customers is at least as many as the number of blue customers.

This problem is equivalent to counting the number of sequences of $n$ reds and $n$ blues such that in every prefix the number of reds is never less than the number of blues. Such sequences are very well studied and are in bijection with *Dyck paths* (or balanced parentheses strings), and their count is given by the $n$th Catalan number:

$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}.
$$

The total number of arrangements of $n$ red and $n$ blue customers is:

$$
\binom{2n}{n}.
$$

Hence, the probability that the seller always has sufficient change is:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{C_n}{\binom{2n}{n}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}}{\binom{2n}{n}} = \frac{1}{n+1}.
$$

Thus, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{ \frac{1}{n+1} }.
$$

**Addendum: Context and Proof of the Dyck Number**

A *Dyck path* of semilength $n$ is a lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$ that never goes below the $x$-axis and uses steps $(1,1)$ (up-steps) and $(1,-1)$ (down-steps). In our ticket problem, we associate a red customer (with a \$5 bill) to an up-step and a blue customer (with a \$10 bill) to a down-step.

The requirement that the seller always has enough change (i.e., the number of red customers is at least the number of blue customers in every prefix) corresponds to the path never dipping below the $x$-axis. Counting these paths is a classical problem, and the number of such paths is known to be the Catalan number:

$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}.
$$
