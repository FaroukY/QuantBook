# Problem 20: Hedge Me Baby One More Time

Suppose you take a long position in _one_ share of stock $A$, whose return has variance $\sigma_A^2$. You wish to hedge this position by shorting $x$ shares of another stock $B$, whose return variance is $\sigma_B^2$. The correlation coefficient between the returns of stocks $A$ and $B$ is $\rho \in [-1, 1]$.

Determine the number of shares $x^*$ of stock $B$ to short that minimizes the variance of the hedged portfolio. That is, minimize the variance of the portfolio consisting of one long share of $A$ and $x$ short shares of $B$.

Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the returns of stocks $A$ and $B$, respectively. The portfolio consists of:

- A long position in 1 share of $A$: contributes $+R_A$,
- A short position in $x$ shares of $B$: contributes $-x R_B$.

Hence, the return of the portfolio is:

$$
R_{\text{portfolio}} = R_A - x R_B.
$$

We aim to minimize the variance of this portfolio return:

$$
\mathrm{Var}(R_{\text{portfolio}}) = \mathrm{Var}(R_A - x R_B).
$$

Using the formula for variance of a linear combination:

$$
\mathrm{Var}(R_A - x R_B) = \sigma_A^2 + x^2 \sigma_B^2 - 2x \rho \sigma_A \sigma_B.
$$

This is a quadratic function in $x$:

$$
f(x) = x^2 \sigma_B^2 - 2x \rho \sigma_A \sigma_B + \sigma_A^2.
$$

To minimize this, take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = 2x \sigma_B^2 - 2 \rho \sigma_A \sigma_B = 0.
$$

Solving for $x$, we obtain:

$$
x^* = \rho \cdot \frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_B}.
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{ x^* = \rho \cdot \frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_B} }
$$

This is the optimal number of shares of stock $B$ to short in order to minimize the variance of the portfolio.
