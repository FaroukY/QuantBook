# Problem 19: Arc Nemesis

Let $\theta_1 \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0, 2\pi)$ be the length of a red arc placed counterclockwise on the unit circle starting from the point $(1, 0)$. Two independent angles $\theta_2, \alpha \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0, 2\pi)$ are also sampled independently.

Define a blue arc of length $\theta_2$ radians starting from the point located $\alpha$ radians counterclockwise from $(1, 0)$. Both arcs are placed in the counterclockwise direction.

What is the probability that the red and blue arcs are disjoint (i.e., they do not overlap on the unit circle)?

An elegant way to attack this problem is to exploit **rotational symmetry**. Since all angles are chosen uniformly from $[0,2\pi]$, we can fix the red arc's starting point at angle $0$ without loss of generality. The red arc covers

$$
R = [0,\theta_1].
$$

The blue arc, starting at $\alpha$ and of length $\theta_2$, covers

$$
B = [\alpha,\alpha+\theta_2] \quad (\mod 2\pi).
$$

Because of the circle's symmetry, the event that the two arcs are disjoint is equivalent to the event that the entire blue arc lies in the *complement* of $R$, i.e., in an interval of total length

$$
2\pi - \theta_1.
$$

**Key Observation:** Given a fixed red arc of length $\theta_1$, the blue arc (of length $\theta_2$) will be disjoint from $R$ if and only if its starting point $\alpha$ lands in a gap long enough to contain it. Since the complement of $R$ has length $2\pi-\theta_1$, the blue arc must lie entirely in an interval of length $2\pi-\theta_1-\theta_2$, provided that 

$$
\theta_2 \le 2\pi-\theta_1.
$$

If $\theta_2 > 2\pi-\theta_1$, the blue arc cannot avoid overlapping $R$; hence the disjointness probability is zero in that case.

Thus, *conditional on* $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, the probability (with respect to $\alpha$) that the blue arc avoids $R$ is

$$
P(\text{disjoint} \mid \theta_1,\theta_2) = \frac{\max\{0,\, 2\pi-\theta_1-\theta_2\}}{2\pi}.
$$

**Averaging over** $\theta_1$ **and** $\theta_2$: Since $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are independent and uniformly distributed on $[0,2\pi]$, the overall probability is

$$
P = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\max\{0,\,2\pi-\theta_1-\theta_2\}}{2\pi}\,d\theta_1\,d\theta_2.
$$

Now we compute the integral

$$
P = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\int_{\theta_1=0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta_2=0}^{2\pi-\theta_1}(2\pi-\theta_1-\theta_2)\,d\theta_2\,d\theta_1.
$$

For a fixed $\theta_1$, we compute the inner integral:

$$
\int_{0}^{2\pi-\theta_1}(2\pi-\theta_1-\theta_2)\,d\theta_2 
= \frac{(2\pi-\theta_1)^2}{2}.
$$

Thus,

$$
P = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{(2\pi-\theta_1)^2}{2}\,d\theta_1.
$$

Make the substitution $u = 2\pi-\theta_1$, so that $du = -d\theta_1$, and as $\theta_1$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi$, $u$ goes from $2\pi$ to $0$. Changing the limits and absorbing the minus sign gives:

$$
\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{(2\pi-\theta_1)^2}{2}\,d\theta_1 = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{u^2}{2}\,du = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{(2\pi)^3}{3} = \frac{4\pi^3}{3}.
$$

It follows that

$$
P = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \cdot \frac{4\pi^3}{3} = \frac{4\pi^3}{3\cdot8\pi^3} = \frac{1}{6}.
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{ \frac{1}{6} }.
$$
