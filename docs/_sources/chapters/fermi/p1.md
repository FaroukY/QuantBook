# Problem 1: Roller Coaster Ride

A sequence $y_1, ..., y_k$ of real numbers is called zigzag if $k=1$, or if $y_2-y_1, y_3-y_2,...,y_k-y_{k-1}$ are nonzero and alternate in sign. For example, $0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, 0.15$ is zigzag. Let $X_1, X_2, ... , X_n$ be chosen independently from the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$. Let $a(X_1, ..., X_n)$ be the longest zigzag subsequence in $X_1, ..., X_n$ (i.e., the largest value of $k$ for which there exists an increasing sequence of integers $i_1, i_2, ... ,i_k$ such that $X_{i_1} , X_{i_2} , ... , X_{i_k}$ is zigzag). Find the expected value of $a(X_1, ..., X_n)$ for $n\geq 2$.

The main difficulty of the problem is simplified significantly by the following crucial observation:

```{admonition} Lemma: Zigzag characterization
:class: tip
The longest zigzag subsequence consists of elements that are either local maxima (*peaks*), local minima (*troughs*), or the endpoints $ X_1 $ and $ X_n $. More precisely, an optimal zigzag subsequence always includes $ X_1 $, $ X_n $, and exactly one point from each monotone segment between consecutive peaks and troughs.
```

```{prf:proof}
To see why this is true, consider an arbitrary zigzag
subsequence. Suppose the subsequence contains two elements from the same
strictly monotone segment between two consecutive local extrema of the
sequence. Since the subsequence is zigzag, the sign of the difference
between consecutive terms must alternate. However, within a strictly
monotone segment, the differences have constant sign, and thus it is
impossible to select more than one point without violating the zigzag
condition.

Conversely, it is always possible to select exactly one point from each
strictly monotone segment. Specifically, if we select each local
extremum (peaks and troughs), along with the first and last elements
(endpoints), the subsequence is clearly zigzag. Furthermore, such a
subsequence is maximal, as argued above. â—»

**Step 2: Probabilistic analysis.**

We now use the Lemma to compute the expected value
$\mathbb{E}[a(X_1,\dots,X_n)]$.

Define indicator random variables $Y_i$, for $2 \leq i \leq n-1$, by

$$
Y_i = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } X_i \text{ is a peak or trough}, \\[5pt]
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

**Step 3: Computing the expectation $\mathbb{E}[Y_i]$.**

Consider three consecutive random variables $X_{i-1}, X_i, X_{i+1}$,
each uniformly and independently distributed on $[0,1]$. There are
$3! = 6$ equally likely possible orderings of these three distinct
points. The variable $Y_i$ equals zero only if the ordering is strictly
increasing or strictly decreasing (i.e., $(X_{i-1},X_i,X_{i+1})$ ordered
as either $1<2<3$ or $3>2>1$). Thus, exactly two out of these six
equally likely permutations correspond to $Y_i=0$.

Therefore,

$$\Pr(Y_i = 0) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \Pr(Y_i = 1) = \frac{2}{3}.$$

Hence, the expectation of $Y_i$ is

$$\mathbb{E}[Y_i] = 1 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.$$

**Step 4: Calculating the expectation by linearity.**

By the Lemma above, the length of the longest zigzag subsequence is
given by: 

$$a(X_1,\dots,X_n) = 2 + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} Y_i,$$ 

where the first and last elements ($X_1, X_n$) are always counted, and each peak
or trough is counted exactly once.

Using linearity of expectation, we get: 

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[a(X_1,\dots,X_n)]
&= 2 + \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} Y_i\right]\\[6pt]
&= 2 + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1}\mathbb{E}[Y_i]\\[6pt]
&= 2 + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1}\frac{2}{3}\\[6pt]
&= 2 + \frac{2(n-2)}{3}\\[6pt]
&= \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2(n-2)}{3}\\[6pt]
&= \frac{2n + 2}{3}.
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, we have the final answer: 

$$\boxed{\frac{2n+2}{3}}.$$
