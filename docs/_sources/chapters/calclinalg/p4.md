# Problem 4: The Great Snowplow Mystery

Snow began to fall at a constant rate some time before noon. The city of Cambridge sent out a snowplow at noon to clear Massachusetts Avenue from MIT to Harvard. The plow removes snow at a constant volume per minute. The plow goes slower when there’s more snow (because it has to clear more volume).

At 1 pm, the plow had cleared 2 miles.
At 2 pm, the plow had cleared a total of 3 miles.

At what time did the snow begin to fall?

Let $W$ be the width of Massachusetts Avenue. Let $t$ denote time since noon (in minutes), and $-T$ be the time it started snowing. Snow falls at a constant rate $\nu_S$ (inches per minute). The plow’s position at time $t$ is $x(t)$ (in miles).

At time $t$, the snow depth is:

$$
h(t) = \nu_S (T + t).
$$

The plow clears snow at a constant volume rate $\nu_P$ (inches $\cdot$ miles per minute). During an infinitesimal interval $dt$, the plow advances by $dx = x(t+dt) - x(t)$. The volume of snow cleared is:

$$
dx \cdot W \cdot h(t) = dx \cdot W \cdot \nu_S (T + t).
$$

Since the plow clears $\nu_P$ per minute, we require:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} \cdot W \cdot \nu_S (T + t) = \nu_P,
$$

or equivalently:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{\nu_P}{W \cdot \nu_S (T + t)} = \frac{C_1}{T + t},
\quad \text{where} \quad C_1 = \frac{\nu_P}{W \nu_S}.
$$

Integrating:

$$
x(t) = C_1 \ln(T + t) + C_2.
$$

**Boundary Conditions**

Given:

$$
x(0) = 0,
\quad
x(60) = 2,
\quad
x(120) = 3,
$$

we get:

$$
C_1 \ln T + C_2 = 0,
\quad
C_1 \ln(T + 60) + C_2 = 2,
\quad
C_1 \ln(T + 120) + C_2 = 3.
$$

Subtracting the first equation to eliminate $C_2$:

$$
C_1 \ln \left( \frac{T + 60}{T} \right) = 2,
\quad
C_1 \ln \left( \frac{T + 120}{T} \right) = 3.
$$

Dividing the two equations:

$$
\frac{ \ln \left( \frac{T + 60}{T} \right) }{ \ln \left( \frac{T + 120}{T} \right) } = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

**Solving for $T$**

Let $L = \ln \left( \frac{T + 120}{T} \right)$. Then:

$$
\ln \left( \frac{T + 60}{T} \right) = \frac{2}{3} L.
$$

Exponentiating:

$$
\frac{T + 60}{T} = \left( \frac{T + 120}{T} \right)^{2/3}.
$$

Multiply through by $T$:

$$
T + 60 = T^{1 - \frac{2}{3}} (T + 120)^{2/3},
\quad \text{or} \quad
T + 60 = T^{1/3} (T + 120)^{2/3}.
$$

Cubing both sides to eliminate the fractional exponents, we ultimately find:

$$
\boxed{ T = 30 \left( \sqrt{5} - 1 \right) \approx 37 \text{ minutes} }.
$$
