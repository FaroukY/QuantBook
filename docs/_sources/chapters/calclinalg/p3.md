# Problem 3: Intersecting Cylinders

Suppose that two cylinders each with radius $1$ intersect at right angles, and their centers also intersect. What is the volume of intersection?

Let the equations of the cylinders be:

$$
x^2 + z^2 \leq 1,
$$

$$
y^2 + z^2 \leq 1.
$$

We need to compute

$$
V = \int\int\int_{x^2+z^2\leq 1, y^2+z^2\leq 1} dx dy dz
$$

Since the volume is symmetric on $(0,0,0)$, we can simply calculate the integral for $x,y,z\geq 0$, and multiply the answer by $8$ representing the 8 orthants. 

$$
V = 8\int\int\int_{x,y,z\geq 0, x^2+z^2\leq 1, y^2+z^2\leq 1} dx dy dz
$$

For a fixed $z$, the boundaries on $x,y$ are $[0, \sqrt{1-z^2}]$, so the integral becomes 

$$
V = 8\int_0^1 \int_0^{\sqrt{1-z^2}}\int_0^\sqrt{1-z^2} dx dy dz = 8\int_0^1 \int_0^{\sqrt{1-z^2}}\sqrt{1-z^2}  dy dz = 8\int_0^1 (1-z^2) dz = \boxed{\frac{16}{3}}
$$
