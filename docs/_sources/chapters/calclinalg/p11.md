$$
\max_{\|x\| = 1} \|A x\|.
$$

We are asked to maximize $\| A x \|$ subject to the constraint $\| x \| = 1$.

This is a classic optimization problem that can be elegantly solved using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.

**Step 1: Reformulation of the Problem**

Since $\| A x \|^2 = (A x)^T (A x) = x^T A^T A x$, we are trying to maximize:

$$
x^T A^T A x \quad \text{subject to} \quad x^T x = 1.
$$

This is precisely a **Rayleigh quotient** problem for the matrix $A^T A$.

**Step 2: Eigenvalues of $A^T A$ and Singular Values of $A$**

- The matrix $A^T A$ is symmetric and positive semidefinite.
- Its eigenvalues are non-negative.
- The eigenvalues of $A^T A$ are the squares of the **singular values** of $A$.

Let:

$$
A = U \Sigma V^T
$$

be the SVD of $A$, where:
- $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is orthogonal,
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is orthogonal,
- $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a diagonal matrix with singular values $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \cdots \geq 0$.

Thus:

$$
A^T A = V \Sigma^T \Sigma V^T.
$$

Hence, the eigenvalues of $A^T A$ are $\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2, \dots$.

**Step 3: Change of Variables**

Letâ€™s define a new vector $y = V^T x$.

- Since $V$ is orthogonal, we have $x = V y$.
- Also, $\|x\|^2 = x^T x = y^T V^T V y = y^T y$.
- Therefore, the constraint $\|x\| = 1$ becomes $\|y\| = 1$.

Substitute back:

$$
x^T A^T A x = x^T V \Sigma^T \Sigma V^T x = y^T \Sigma^T \Sigma y.
$$

But $\Sigma^T \Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2, \dots$.

Therefore:

$$
x^T A^T A x = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i^2 y_i^2,
$$

where $r = \min(m, n)$ (the number of non-zero singular values).

Our problem is now:

$$
\max_{y \in \mathbb{R}^n, \|y\| = 1} \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i^2 y_i^2.
$$

---

**Step 4: Optimization over $y$**

We wish to maximize $\sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i^2 y_i^2$ under the constraint:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 = 1.
$$

Since $\sigma_1^2 \geq \sigma_2^2 \geq \dots$, the sum is maximized by allocating as much "weight" as possible to $y_1$.

- To maximize the sum, we choose $y_1 = 1$, and $y_2 = y_3 = \dots = y_n = 0$.

Thus:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i^2 y_i^2 = \sigma_1^2.
$$

---

**Step 5: Back to the Original Variable**

Recall $y = V^T x$.

Thus, the optimal $x$ corresponds to:

$$
x = V y = V e_1,
$$

where $e_1$ is the first standard basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

- In other words, the maximizing $x$ is the **first right singular vector of $A$**.

---

**Final Answer**

$$
\max_{\|x\| = 1} \|A x\| = \sqrt{ \sigma_1^2 } = \sigma_1.
$$

where $\sigma_1$ is the **largest singular value of $A$**.
