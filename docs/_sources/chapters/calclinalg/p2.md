# Problem 2: The Battle of $\pi$ and $e$

Without calculating the exact values, which is bigger $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$?

One of the most useful inequalities in mathematics and computer science is:

$$
1 + x \leq e^x
$$

for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This follows from the Taylor series expansion of $e^x$:

$$
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \geq 1 + x.
$$

This inequality holds for positive $x$ by termwise positivity, and also for negative $x$ (with a bit more care).

Now, returning to the problem at hand, we use the inequality:

$$
1 + x \leq e^x,
$$

and substitute $x = \frac{\pi}{e} - 1$ to get:

$$
\frac{\pi}{e} \leq \frac{1}{e} \cdot \left( e^{\pi} \right)^{1/e}.
$$

Multiplying both sides by $e$, we obtain:

$$
\pi \leq \left( e^{\pi} \right)^{1/e}.
$$

Raising both sides to the power of $e$ yields:

$$
\pi^e \leq e^{\pi}.
$$

Thus, we conclude the desired inequality.
