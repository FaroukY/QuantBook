The probability density function of a standard Gaussian random variable is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}.
$$

By symmetry, the integral over the positive half-line is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} = \int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2/2} \, dx.
$$

Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{2\pi}$:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2/2} \, dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}.
$$
