# Problem 2: Jaws: Circular Logic

A man stands at the center of a circular field, which is bordered by a narrow ring of water. In the water swims a shark that can move at four times the man's maximum running speed. The shark can move freely and instantly change direction within the water ring, but cannot enter the field.

The man may run anywhere within the field, and if he steps into the water, he crosses the ring to the outer boundary to escape as long as the shark is not waiting for him there. The goal is to determine: **Can the man guarantee an escape from the field without being caught by the shark?**

Yes, the man **can** guarantee an escape using a clever strategy based on **angular lag**. The idea is to exploit the fact that the shark must move along the **perimeter** of the circle (a longer path), while the man can move **directly**.

**Winning Strategy**

Without loss of generality, assume the circle has radius $1$. The man's strategy consists of two phases:

1. **Circle-Shaving**:
   - The man moves into a smaller concentric circle of radius $r < 1$ and begins moving along this circle.
   - While remaining at radius $r$, he gains angular speed relative to the shark.
   - The man's angular speed is:

     $$
     \frac{1 \cdot \sin \theta}{r}
     $$

   - The shark's angular speed is:

     $$
     \frac{4 \cdot \sin \theta}{1}
     $$

   - The man gains a phase advantage if:

     $$
     \frac{1 \cdot \sin \theta}{r} > \frac{4 \cdot \sin \theta}{1}
     \iff r < \frac{1}{4}
     $$

   - So he chooses a radius $r < \frac{1}{4}$ and begins circling until the shark is diametrically opposite.

2. **Sudden Dash**:
   - Once the shark is directly opposite, the man sprints radially outward in the direction away from the shark.
   - The man travels a radial distance of $(1 - r)$, taking time $(1 - r)$.
   - The shark must travel half the circle's perimeter: distance $\pi$, taking time $\pi/4$.
   - For the man to escape before the shark arrives:

     $$
     1 - r < \frac{\pi}{4}
     \iff r > 1 - \frac{\pi}{4}
     $$

   - So the feasible range for $r$ is:

     $$
     1 - \frac{\pi}{4} \leq r \leq \frac{1}{4}
     $$

   - Numerically, this means:

     $$
     0.215 \leq r \leq 0.25
     $$

   - Any $r$ in that range guarantees escape.
