# Problem 13: Tight Fit

You have $n$ pairs of gloves that each have a distinct number, $1$ to $n$. The $2n$ gloves are randomly paired up. Find the probability that the gloves are paired up such that the values of any pair differ by at most $1$.

**Step 1. Total number of pairings.**

We begin with $2n$ gloves, each with a unique label (e.g., left and right gloves labeled $1$ through $n$). We want to count the number of ways to pair them into $n$ unordered pairs, where:

- The order of gloves within each pair does *not* matter: $(a, b)$ is the same as $(b, a)$.
- The order of the $n$ pairs themselves also does *not* matter: $\{(a, b), (c, d)\}$ is the same as $\{(c, d), (a, b)\}$.

We proceed in three steps:

1. There are $(2n)!$ ways to list all $2n$ gloves in a sequence.  
2. We divide by $2^n$ to account for the fact that within each of the $n$ pairs, the order doesn’t matter.  
3. We further divide by $n!$ because the order in which the $n$ pairs appear doesn’t matter either.

Therefore, the total number of unordered pairings of $2n$ distinct items is:

$$
 \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}.
$$

*Example:* For $n = 2$, the gloves are labeled $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. The six pairings:

$$
\{(1,2),(3,4)\},\quad \{(1,3),(2,4)\},\quad \{(1,4),(2,3)\}
$$

each appear in $2^2 \cdot 2! = 8$ of the $4! = 24$ raw permutations, confirming:

$$
\frac{4!}{2^2 \cdot 2!} = 3.
$$

**Step 2. Count the number of valid pairings.**

Let $P_n$ denote the number of pairings of the gloves such that every pair consists of gloves whose labels differ by at most $1$. We will show that $P_n$ satisfies the recurrence:

$$
P_n = P_{n-1} + 2P_{n-2}, \qquad P_0 = 1,\quad P_1 = 1.
$$

- If the two gloves labeled $n$ are paired together, then the remaining $2n-2$ gloves (with labels $1$ through $n-1$) must form a valid configuration. This contributes $P_{n-1}$.

- If each glove labeled $n$ is paired with a glove labeled $n-1$, there are two ways to assign these pairings (since each label appears exactly twice), and the remaining $2n-4$ gloves (with labels $1$ through $n-2$) must be validly paired. This contributes $2P_{n-2}$.

Hence, the recurrence holds.

---

**Step 3. Solve the recurrence.**

We solve:

$$
P_n = P_{n-1} + 2P_{n-2}, \qquad P_0 = 1,\quad P_1 = 1.
$$

This is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:

$$
r^2 - r - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 2,\ -1.
$$

The general solution is:

$$
P_n = A \cdot 2^n + B \cdot (-1)^n.
$$

Use initial conditions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_0 &= A + B = 1, \\
P_1 &= 2A - B = 1.
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving:

$$
A = \frac{2}{3}, \quad B = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

Therefore, the closed-form is:

$$
P_n = \frac{1}{3} \left( 2^{n+1} + (-1)^n \right).
$$

---

**Step 4. Final probability.**

- There are $P_n$ valid pairings of glove labels.  
- The total number of pairings of $2n$ gloves is $\dfrac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$.

Hence, the desired probability is:

$$
\frac{P_n \cdot 2^n n!}{(2n)!} = \boxed{ \frac{(2^{n+1}+ (-1)^n) \cdot 2^n n!}{3 (2n)!} }.
$$
