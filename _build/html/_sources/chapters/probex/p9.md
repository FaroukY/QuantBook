# Problem 9: Spaghetti Topology

You have $n$ noodles in a bowl. Each noodle has two loose ends, for a total of $2n$ ends. Repeatedly, you select two free ends uniformly at random and tie them together to form a connection. You continue this process until all ends are paired.

At the end, the noodles will form one or more closed loops (where a ``loop'' is a sequence of ends connected such that it closes back on itself). Let $L_n$ be the number of such loops formed. Find an expression for the expected value $\mathbb{E}[L_n]$. How does this behave asymptotically?

**Step 1. Recursive structure.**  
We begin with $n$ noodles, each having two free ends, for a total of $2n$ ends. At each step, we select two free ends uniformly at random and tie them together. We repeat this process until all ends are paired.

Let $L_n$ denote the number of loops formed by the end of the process.

To derive a recurrence, condition on the first pairing: pick an end arbitrarily, and let it belong to some noodle. There are $2n-1$ other free ends it could connect to. Among these, exactly one is the other end of the same noodle, which would immediately form a 1-loop. The remaining $2n-2$ ends must connect two different noodles, effectively reducing the total number of noodles by one and making one longer noodle.

*Illustration:* Each node represents a free end. Arcs show how ends are tied together. Loops may involve multiple noodles chained together into a single closed cycle.

$$
\mathbb{E}[L_n] = \frac{1}{2n-1}(1 + \mathbb{E}[L_{n-1}]) + \frac{2n-2}{2n-1} \cdot \mathbb{E}[L_{n-1}] = \frac{1}{2n-1} + \mathbb{E}[L_{n-1}].
$$

**Step 2. Solving the recurrence.**  
Unrolling the recurrence:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2i - 1}.
$$

This is the sum of the first $n$ odd reciprocals:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L_n] = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n - 1}.
$$

**Step 3. Asymptotic behavior.**  
To understand the growth of this sum, we relate it to the harmonic series. The sum of reciprocals of the first $2n$ integers is:

$$
H_{2n} = \sum_{k=1}^{2n} \frac{1}{k} = \ln(2n) + \gamma + o(1).
$$

The sum of the reciprocals of the even integers up to $2n$ is:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k} = \frac{1}{2} H_n = \frac{1}{2} \ln(n) + \frac{\gamma}{2} + o(1).
$$

Therefore, the sum of the odd reciprocals is:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2i - 1} = H_{2n} - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k} = \ln(2n) - \frac{1}{2} \ln(n) + O(1) = \frac{1}{2} \ln(n) + O(1).
$$

Hence, the expected number of loops satisfies:

$$
\mathbb{E}[L_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2i - 1} \sim \frac{1}{2} \ln(n).
$$

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[L_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2i - 1} \sim \frac{1}{2} \ln(n)}
$$
