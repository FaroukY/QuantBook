# Problem 8: Card Sandwich

Suppose we randomly deal cards one by one from a standard $52$-card deck. Let $X$ be the number of cards that appear strictly between the first $\texttt{2}$ and the first $\texttt{Ace}$ in the deck.

What is the expected value of $X$, given that the first $\texttt{2}$ appears before the first $\texttt{Ace}$?

**Step 1. Compressing the Problem.**  
Focus only on the *special cards*—the four `2`s and four `Aces`. Since the deck is uniformly shuffled, the positions of these $8$ cards among the $52$ total are equally likely to be any $8$-subset of $\{1,2,\dots,52\}$. Denote their ordered positions by:

$$
Y_1 < Y_2 < \cdots < Y_8.
$$

A standard fact from order statistics tells us that:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_i] = \frac{(52 + 1)i}{8 + 1} = \frac{53i}{9}.
$$

Therefore, the expected gap between consecutive special cards is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_{i+1} - Y_i] = \frac{53}{9}.
$$

Let $v(Y_i)$ denote the identity of the card at position $Y_i$—either a `2` or an `Ace`. Crucially, the values $v(Y_i)$ are independent of the positions $Y_i$: we may first sample the positions, and then assign the values uniformly among the 4 `2`s and 4 `Aces`.

**Step 2. Conditioning on the Event.**  
Let $E$ be the event that $v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}$, i.e., the earliest special card is a `2`. Define the random variable $m$ (with $2 \le m \le 8$) to be the index of the first Ace among the $v(Y_i)$. Then, the number of cards that lie strictly between the first `2` and the first Ace is:

$$
X = Y_m - Y_1 - 1.
$$

We now compute the conditional expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X \mid E] = \mathbb{E}[Y_m - Y_1 - 1 \mid v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}].
$$

Since the expected spacing between consecutive $Y_i$ is constant and equal to $\frac{53}{9}$, we apply linearity of expectation to the sum:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_m - Y_1 - 1 \mid v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}] = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=2}^{m}(Y_i - Y_{i-1}) \,\middle|\, v(Y_1) = \texttt{2} \right] - 1 = \mathbb{E}[m - 1 \mid v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}] \cdot \frac{53}{9} - 1.
$$

Here we’ve used Wald’s identity, along with the fact that the differences $Y_i - Y_{i-1}$ are i.i.d. and independent of $v(Y_1)$.

---

**Step 3. Computing $\mathbb{E}[m - 1 \mid v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}]$.**  
Given that $v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}$, we must find the expected number of steps until the first Ace appears among the remaining $7$ special cards, where 4 of them are Aces.

This is the classic "wait until first success" expectation: among 7 cards with 4 Aces and 3 `2`s, the expected position of the first Ace is a hypergeometric distribution, and the expected number of non-Aces before the first Ace among 7 cards (with 4 Aces) is:

$$
\frac{7 + 1}{5} = \frac{8}{5}.
$$

---

**Step 4. Final calculation.**  
Putting everything together:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X \mid v(Y_1) = \texttt{2}] = \frac{8}{5} \cdot \frac{53}{9} - 1 = \frac{424}{45} - 1 = \boxed{\frac{379}{45}}.
$$
