# Quant Interview Handbook

## Preface

Quantitative trading and research interviews demand both strong technical skills and creative problem-solving. This book is a focused preparation guide for candidates with a solid mathematical background. It features a curated selection of problems with *detailed solutions*, drawn from prior interview questions, quantitative interview prep materials, and classic mathematical puzzle books. The problems span a wide range of topics and are designed to reflect the style and depth of questions used by top quant firms.

## Target Audience

This book is intended for readers with mathematical maturity - those comfortable with concepts such as random variables, linearity of expectation, calculus, basic statistics, algorithms, programming, and linear algebra. It does not assume prior experience with competitive problem-solving or timed interviews. While foundational material is not re-taught, new or advanced ideas are introduced as needed. The goal is to help readers translate their theoretical knowledge into the creative, applied reasoning required in quantitative interviews.
