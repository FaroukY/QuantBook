# Problem 14: All In (or Not)

$A$ and $B$ are sampled uniformly at random from all $2^n$ subsets of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$. What is the probability that $A\subseteq B$?

Let $p_n$ denote the probability that, for two independently and uniformly chosen subsets $A, B \subseteq \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, we have $A \subseteq B$.

**Step 1. Recurrence idea.**

We build up from $n - 1$ to $n$ by conditioning on whether $n$ is in $A$ and/or $B$.

There are two cases under which $A \subseteq B$ holds with respect to element $n$:

1. **$n \not\in A$:**  
   In this case, we don't care whether $n \in B$ or not; the containment condition is unaffected. This happens with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ for $A$ (excluding $n$), and the rest proceeds with subsets of $\{1, \dots, n-1\}$, contributing:

   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \cdot p_{n-1}.
   $$

2. **$n \in A$:**  
   For $A \subseteq B$ to hold, $B$ must also contain $n$. The probability that $B$ includes $n$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, and again the rest reduces to $p_{n-1}$. So this case contributes:

   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot p_{n-1}.
   $$

**Step 2. Recurrence relation.**

Adding both contributions:

$$
p_n = \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \right) p_{n-1} = \frac{3}{4} p_{n-1}.
$$

Since $p_0 = 1$ (both $A$ and $B$ are empty subsets), we have:

$$
p_n = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^n.
$$

---

**Final answer:**

$$
\boxed{ \mathbb{P}(A \subseteq B) = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^n }
$$
