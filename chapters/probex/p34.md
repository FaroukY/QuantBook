# Problem 34: One Roll, Two Rolls, Tomato, Tomahto

Is it possible to construct a non-fair $n$-sided die (with arbitrary probabilities on faces $1$ through $n$) such that for each integer $k \in \{2, 3, \dots, n\}$, the probability that a single roll yields $k$ is equal to the probability that the sum of two independent rolls equals $k$? What is $p_1$ in the limit as $n\to \infty$?

**Step 1: Recognizing the recurrence.**  
We wish to construct an $n$-sided die with probabilities $(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$ satisfying:

$$
p_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} p_i p_{k-i}, \quad \text{for all } 2 \leq k \leq n.
$$

This is the **Catalan convolution recurrence**, which, with $p_1 = x$, leads to:

$$
p_k = x^k C_{k-1},
$$

where the $k$-th Catalan number is:

$$
C_k = \frac{1}{k+1} \binom{2k}{k}.
$$

**Step 2: Normalize the distribution.**  
We require:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^n p_k = \sum_{k=1}^n x^k C_{k-1} = 1.
$$

Define:

$$
f_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n x^k C_{k-1}.
$$

This is continuous and strictly increasing on $(0,1)$, and since $f_n(0) = 0$ and $f_n(1) > 1$, there exists $x \in (0,1)$ such that $f_n(x) = 1$.

---

**Step 3: Infinite case and asymptotics.**  
For each $n$, define:

$$
p_k^{(n)} = x_n^k C_{k-1}, \quad k = 1,\dots,n,
$$

where $x_n$ solves:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^n x_n^k C_{k-1} = 1.
$$

Define the infinite series:

$$
f(x) := \sum_{k=1}^\infty x^k C_{k-1} = x \sum_{j=0}^\infty x^j C_j = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2}, \quad \text{for } x < \tfrac{1}{4}.
$$

Then $f(x) < 1$ for $x < \tfrac{1}{4}$, so we must have $x_n > \tfrac{1}{4}$. As $n \to \infty$, $x_n \to \tfrac{1}{4}$.

---

**Limiting probabilities.**  
For fixed $k$, we have:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} p_k^{(n)} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^k C_{k-1} =: p_k^{(\infty)}.
$$

This gives the limiting sequence:

$$
p_k^{(\infty)} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^k C_{k-1}, \quad k \ge 1,
$$

which satisfies the same recurrence, but does **not** sum to 1. The total mass is:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty p_k^{(\infty)} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^k C_{k-1} = f\left( \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

So half the probability mass escapes to infinity.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The limiting value of $p_1$ is:

$$
\boxed{p_1 = \frac{1}{4}}.
$$

For finite $n$, we can set:

$$
\boxed{p_k = \hat{x}^k C_{k-1}}
$$

where $\hat{x}$ solves:

$$
\boxed{\sum_{k=1}^n x^k C_{k-1} = 1}.
$$

---

**Addendum: Catalan Convolution and Scaling**

The recurrence

$$
p_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} p_i p_{k-i}, \quad k \ge 2
$$

with $p_1 = x$ leads to:

- $p_2 = x^2$
- $p_3 = 2x^3$
- $p_4 = 5x^4$
- etc.

This yields the general form:

$$
p_k = x^k C_{k-1}.
$$
