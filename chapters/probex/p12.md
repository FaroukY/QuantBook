# Problem 12: Chop, Chop, Triangle?

A stick of unit length is randomly broken into three pieces. Assuming each break follows a uniform distribution along the stick, what is the probability that the three segments can form a triangle?

We break a stick of unit length at two points chosen independently and uniformly at random. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the break points, chosen uniformly in $[0,1]$. Without loss of generality, assume $0 < X < Y < 1$ and multiply the final probability by 2 to account for symmetry.

The three segment lengths are:

$$
a = X,\quad b = Y - X,\quad c = 1 - Y.
$$

These can form a triangle if and only if the triangle inequality holds; that is, the largest segment is less than the sum of the other two. Since $a + b + c = 1$, the triangle inequality is equivalent to:

$$
\max(a, b, c) < \frac{1}{2}.
$$

**Geometric Region:**  
We consider the triangle $0 < x < y < 1$ in the unit square, and compute the area where:

$$
x < \frac{1}{2},\quad y - x < \frac{1}{2},\quad 1 - y < \frac{1}{2} \iff y > \frac{1}{2}.
$$

So the region is:

$$
\left\{ (x,y) : y - \tfrac{1}{2} \le x \le \tfrac{1}{2},\quad \tfrac{1}{2} \le y \le 1 \right\}.
$$

The region of valid break points \((x,y)\) where the resulting segments form a triangle has area:

$$
\frac{1}{8}.
$$

So the total probability is:

$$
2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.
$$
