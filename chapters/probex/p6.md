# Problem 6: Rigged Roll

Which has a greater probability of rolling doubles, a pair of fair die, or a pair of non-fair die? Why?

Let the probabilities for rolling numbers $1, \dots, n$ on the (possibly unfair) die be $p_1, \dots, p_n$. The probability of rolling doubles is:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2.
$$

Applying the Cauchyâ€“Schwarz inequality with vectors $(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ and $(1,\dots,1)$, we have:

$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1^2\right).
$$

Since $\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 1$, this simplifies to:

$$
1 \leq n \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2 \geq \frac{1}{n}.
$$

Equality holds if and only if $p_i = \frac{1}{n}$ for all $i$, i.e., if and only if the die is fair.

Therefore, an unfair die always has a strictly greater probability of rolling doubles than a fair one:

$$
\boxed{\text{A pair of unfair dice is more likely to roll doubles than a pair of fair dice.}}
$$
