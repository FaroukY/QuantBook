# Problem 37: Matching Madness

A drawer contains red socks and black socks. Two socks are drawn uniformly at random without replacement. The probability that both socks are red is $\tfrac12$.

1. What is the smallest possible total number of socks in the drawer?  
2. What is the smallest possible total number of socks if the number of black socks is even?

**(a)** Let $r$ be the number of red socks and $b$ the number of blue socks. The total number of socks is $r + b$, and the probability of drawing two red socks is:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{both red}) = \frac{r}{r + b} \cdot \frac{r - 1}{r + b - 1} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Multiply both sides by $(r + b)(r + b - 1)$ to get:

$$
2r(r - 1) = (r + b)(r + b - 1).
$$

Letâ€™s solve for $b$ in terms of $r$:

$$
(r + b)(r + b - 1) = 2r(r - 1) \quad \Rightarrow \quad
b = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt{8r^2 - 8r + 1} - 2r + 1 \right).
$$

We search for the smallest integer $r \geq 2$ such that $b$ is an integer. Trying small values:

- For $r = 3$:  

$$
b = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt{8 \cdot 9 - 24 + 1} - 6 + 1 \right)
= \frac{1}{2} ( \sqrt{49} - 5 ) = \frac{1}{2}(7 - 5) = 1.
$$

Thus, the smallest possible total number of socks is:

$$
\boxed{4}.
$$

**(b)** Now suppose the number of blue socks is required to be even. From the same identity:

$$
2r(r - 1) = (r + b)(r + b - 1),
$$

we now solve for $r$ in terms of $b$:

$$
r = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt{8b^2 + 1} + 2b + 1 \right).
$$

We look for the smallest even integer $b$ such that $r$ is also an integer.

Trying values:

- $b = 2$:  

$$
r = \frac{1}{2} ( \sqrt{33} + 5 ) \quad \text{not integer}
$$

- $b = 4$:  

$$
r = \frac{1}{2} ( \sqrt{129} + 9 ) \quad \text{not integer}
$$

- $b = 6$:  

$$
r = \frac{1}{2} ( \sqrt{289} + 13 ) = \frac{1}{2}(17 + 13) = 15
$$

So $r = 15$, $b = 6$, total socks:

$$
\boxed{21}.
$$
