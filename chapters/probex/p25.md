# Problem 25: Roll to Completion

You roll a fair 6-sided die $n$ times. What is the probability that all six faces (numbers $1$ through $6$) appear at least once among the $n$ rolls?

We are interested in the probability that all six faces $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ appear at least once in $n$ independent rolls of a fair $6$-sided die. For coverage problems like this one, a very useful principle to keep at the back of your mind is the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let $M_i$ be the event that face $i$ is *missing* from the $n$ rolls. We are trying to compute:

$$
\Pr\left[\,\bigcap_{i=1}^6 \overline{M_i}\,\right] 
= 1 - \Pr\left[\,\bigcup_{i=1}^6 M_i\,\right].
$$

We apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to compute the probability that *some face is missing*. For any subset $S \subseteq \{1,2,\dots,6\}$, let $M_S = \bigcap_{i \in S} M_i$ be the event that *all* faces in $S$ are missing. Since each roll is uniform and independent, the probability that a roll does not land on any value in $S$ is $\frac{6 - |S|}{6}$. Hence,

$$
\Pr[M_S] = \left(\frac{6 - |S|}{6}\right)^n.
$$

By inclusion-exclusion,

$$
\Pr\left[\,\bigcup_{i=1}^6 M_i\,\right]
=
\sum_{k=1}^6 (-1)^{k+1}
\sum_{\substack{S \subseteq \{1,\dots,6\} \\ |S| = k}}
\Pr[M_S]
=
\sum_{k=1}^6 (-1)^{k+1} \binom{6}{k} \left( \frac{6 - k}{6} \right)^n.
$$

Therefore, the desired probability is:

$$
\Pr\left[\,\bigcap_{i=1}^6 \overline{M_i}\,\right]
=
1 - \sum_{k=1}^6 (-1)^{k+1} \binom{6}{k} \left( \frac{6 - k}{6} \right)^n.
$$

Or, written directly:

$$
\Pr[\text{all faces appear}]
=
\boxed{
1-\frac{1}{6^n} \left[
{6 \choose 1} 5^n
- {6 \choose 2} 4^n
+ {6 \choose 3} 3^n
- {6 \choose 4} 2^n
+ {6 \choose 5} 1^n
\right]
}
$$

(Note: the final term is zero when $n \ge 1$.)
