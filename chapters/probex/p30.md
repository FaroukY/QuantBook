# Problem 30: Dice Dropout

You roll $n$ fair 6-sided dice. After each roll, you remove all dice that show a $1$ and re-roll the remaining dice. You repeat this process until all dice have been removed. On average, how many total rolls will you make? Can you give an upper bound on this quantity?

Let $n_0 = n$ be the number of dice initially, and let $n_i$ denote the number of dice remaining after round $i$ (i.e., before round $i+1$). Define $T$ to be the total number of rounds until all dice are eliminated, so $n_T = 0$.

Each die has a $\frac{1}{6}$ chance of being removed in any round, independently of the others. Therefore, conditioned on $n_{i-1}$ dice remaining at round $i-1$, the expected number of dice that survive into round $i$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[n_i \mid n_{i-1}] = \frac{5}{6}n_{i-1}.
$$

By iterated expectation (law of total expectation), this implies:

$$
\mathbb{E}[n_i] = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^i n.
$$

Next, we bound the probability that $T \ge i$. Note that $T \ge i$ if and only if $n_i \ge 1$, since the process only terminates when all dice are removed. Applying Markov's inequality:

$$
\Pr[T \ge i] = \Pr[n_i \ge 1] \le \frac{\mathbb{E}[n_i]}{1} = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^i n.
$$

Next, we bound the expected number of rounds. Using the tail-sum formula for expectations:

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \Pr[T \ge i].
$$

Let $i^* = \left\lceil \frac{\log(2n)}{\log(6/5)} \right\rceil$. Then:

$$
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{i^*} n \le \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Split the sum:

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \Pr[T \ge i] = \sum_{i=1}^{i^*} \Pr[T \ge i] + \sum_{i=i^*+1}^{\infty} \Pr[T \ge i].
$$

We bound each part:

- The first sum has at most $i^*$ terms, each at most $1$.
- The second sum is at most:

  $$
  \sum_{i = i^*+1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^i n \le \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^i = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{5/6}{1 - 5/6} = \frac{5}{2}.
  $$

**Conclusion:**

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] \le i^* + \frac{5}{2} = \boxed{O(\log n)}.
$$
